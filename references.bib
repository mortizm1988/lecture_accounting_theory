  abstract  = {This is an article about modeling methods in information economics. A notion of "favorableness" of news is introduced, characterized, and applied to four simple models. In the equilibria of these models, (1) the arrival of good news about a firm's prospects always causes its share price to rise, (2) more favorable evidence about an agent's effort leads the principal to pay a larger bonus, (3) buyers expect that any product information withheld by a salesman is unfavorable to his product, and (4) bidders figure that low bids by their competitors signal a low value for the object being sold.},

I discuss the formulation of models of incentive problems caused by moral hazard and adverse selection problems. I review theoretical research on the role of performance measures in compensation contracts, and I compare how information is aggregated for compensation purposes versus valuation purposes. I also review the literature on communication, including models where the revelation principle does not apply so that nontruthful reporting and earnings management can take place. The paper also discusses capital allocation within firms, including transfer pricing and cost allocation problems. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes how earnings and price are used in executive compensation contracts. Risk-averse shareholders collectively design a contract and individually trade in the stock market. In the optimal linear contract the use of earnings and price depends critically on incentive efficiency, i.e., how precisely the measures convey the true outcome. The relative weight of price to earnings exaggerates the true relative importance of price because price impounds traders' overall information while its informational value lies in the incremental information it provides. The use of price allows shareholders to share trading risks with managers.}
