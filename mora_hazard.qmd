# Introduction to Moral Hazard

Moral hazard arises when one party in a transaction can take actions that affect the value of the transaction for the other party. However, those actions are either unobservable or only imperfectly inferable by the affected party. This problem typically occurs in situations where two conditions are present: **hidden action** and **risk aversion**.

1. **Hidden action**: Refers to actions taken by one party that cannot be directly monitored or measured by the other party. As a result, the affected party cannot perfectly determine whether adverse outcomes are due to poor performance, lack of effort, or external factors.

2. **Risk aversion**: At least one of the parties involved must prefer avoiding risk. They value stability and predictability, often making them cautious about transactions or agreements that expose them to unpredictable outcomes.

The moral hazard problem is fundamentally about the misalignment of incentives between parties. Specifically, the party whose actions are unobservable might not have adequate incentives to act in the best interest of the other party. 

Solving Moral hazard conflicts implies solving two challenges:

1. **Provision of adequate incentives**: Designing mechanisms to motivate the party taking the hidden action to behave in a way that aligns with the other party's goals.
2. **Efficient risk distribution**: Finding a balance in how risk is shared between the parties, so that each party bears the appropriate level of risk without undermining incentives.

These two objectives often conflict. There is a substitution effect: when one party is overly shielded from risk, they may lack the incentive to take efficient actions that benefit the other party. As a result, designing an optimal compensation or incentive scheme requires balancing risk-sharing with providing the right incentives.

The focus of this class will be moral hazard conflicts arising within a firm, typically between a shareholder (the pricipal) and a manager (the agent). The principal aims to hire the agent for running a risky project, and offers the agent a contract which stablishes the agent's compensation conditional on the outcome of the risky project. The agent first decides whether to accept the contract and then how much effort put into managing the project. The principal requires informations to infer the value of the project's outcome and the agent's effort  to be able to compute the agent's compensation and its own net profits. 

In this setting, accounting is naturally embedded into moral hazard problems. **Accounting information** must have several key characteristics to be useful for decision-making. Accounting information must be relevant, comparable, verifiable, and timeliness. Scholars have studied how these characteristics can be used to design optimal contracts that mitigate moral hazard problems. 

This reading note starts by developing a simple example of a moral hazard problem to illustrate the nature of the problem and the trade-offs involved in solving it. We then move on to a more general moral hazard model, allowing us to add further features to the model. We will also discuss how accounting systems must generate **performance measures**, and how these measures can be used to design optimal contracts. Then, we discuss the role of comparability for **relative performance evaluation** and the role of disclosure of **verifiable** private information in the context of moral hazard. Lastly, we will discuss how the **timeliness** of accounting information can be used to design dynamic incentive contracts.

## A very simple example

Let’s assume that a company (principal) hires a manager (agent) responsible for running the business. The company’s outcomes depend on both random factors and the manager’s effort. For now, let's assume the effort can be either high (A) or low (B), and the company's outcomes can either be success (E) or failure (F). The company’s profit in the success scenario is \$360, and in the failure scenario, it is \$200. The probability of success is 75% with high effort and 25% with low effort.

Therefore, the expected profit of the principal when effort is high is: $360 \times 0.75 + 200 \times 0.25 = 320$. In contrast, when the effort is low the expected profit is: $360 \times 0.25 + 200 \times 0.75 = 240$.

This can be summarized in the following table:

|                 | High Effort (A) | Low Effort (B) |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Success (S)     | 75%             | 25%            |
| Failure (F)     | 25%             | 75%            |
| Expected Profit | \$320           | \$240          |

We assume that the principal seeks to maximize the expected value of their net profits (expected value minus the payment to the agent). For now, let's consider the principal to be risk-neutral.

The agent (manager) aims to maximize an expected utility function of the form:

$$
U = U(w) - v(e)
$$

Where $U(w)$ is the utility of the payment received (remuneration), and $v(e)$ is the cost of effort $e$.

We can distinguish four possible cases:

1.  Observable effort, risk-neutral agent
2.  Non-observable effort, risk-neutral agent
3.  Observable effort, risk-averse agent
4.  Non-observable effort, risk-averse agent

### Observable Effort, Risk-Neutral Agent

Let’s assume an agent with a utility function $U = w - v(e)$, and a reservation utility of $\underline{U} = 81$. The costs of effort are $v(B) = 0$ and $v(A) = 63$. (The numbers are arbitrary and chosen to facilitate later comparisons).

If the principal settles for low effort, they offer the agent a salary equal to the reservation utility $w = 81$. The expected profit for the principal is 240, and the net benefit is $240 - 81 = 159$.

If the principal wants to ensure high effort, the agent’s remuneration must cover the disutility of effort, i.e., $w = 81 + 63 = 144$. The net profit for the principal in this case is $320 - 144 = 176$.

Thus, for the principal, the best alternative is to offer a fixed payment of 144 and obtain an expected profit of 176.

### Non-Observable Effort, Risk-Neutral Agent

Now, consider the case where the effort (A or B) is non-observable and the agent continue being risk-neutral. In this case, the conflict between incentives and risk distribution is easily resolved. The most effective way to provide incentives is to make the agent bear all the consequences of their decisions.

The contract cannot depend on effort because effort is neither observable nor verifiable. However, results such as profits are observable. Therefore, the principal can exploit the correlation between effort and profits to incentivize the agent. The principal will pay $X$ in case of success (\$E\$), and $Y$ in case of failure ($F$). This introduces uncertainty for the agent.

The principal can induce high effort by offering the agent a contract characterized by a compensation conditional on the outcome: $W_E$ and $W_F$, with the following requirements:

1.  **Individual Rationality**: The utility for the agent must be greater than their reservation utility.
2.  **Incentive Compatibility**: The utility of exerting high effort must be greater than the utility of low effort, i.e.,$E[U(A)] > E[U(B)]$.

In our example, the constraints are:

$$
0.75 W_E + 0.25 W_F - 63 \geq 81
$$
$$
0.75 W_E + 0.25 W_F - 63 \geq 0.25 W_E + 0.75 W_F
$$

As it is inefficient for the principal to pay more than needed to influence effort, the previous system of inequations are solved at the equality conditions. The optimal contract in this case involves:

$$
W_E = 184, \quad W_F = 24.
$$

### Observable Effort, Risk-Averse Agent

Qhat happens when we have a risk-averse agent? For example, assume the utility function $U = W^{1/2} - v(e)$, where $v(A) = 3$ and $v(B) = 0$, and the reservation utility is $\underline{U} = 9$.

To induce low effort, it is sufficient to offer a fixed salary that yields a utility level equal to or greater than the reservation utility ($W=\underline{U}^2=81$). The principal's expected net profit is $240 - 81 = 159$, the same as in the scenario with a risk-neutral agent.

To induce high effort, the agent needs to be compensated for the additional disutility of the high effort. As effort can be observed, this can be achieved with a fixed salary of $144=(\underline{U}+3)^2$, conditioned on high effort . Thus, the expected net profit for the principal is $320 - 144 = 176$, higher than the profit for low effort (though it may not always be optimal to pay for high effort).

In this case, the agent’s risk aversion does not pose a problem since there is no uncertainty involved. The agent's action and payment are not contingent on the state of nature.[^1]

[^1]: Additionally, if the agent has bargaining power, they could negotiate up to 161 for high effort. Analyse the Edgeworth box representation.

### Non-Observable Effort and Risk-Averse Agent

The lack of observability of effort forces to create the compensation contract contingent on outcomes (which are correlated with effort) or abandoning variable compensation altogether. In this scenario we can see the main conflict in moral hazard problems:

-   **Efficient Risk Distribution**: the risk-neutral party (the principal) should bear all the risk, while the risk-averse party (the agent) remains on the certainty line.

-   **Incentive Problem**: For proper incentives, the agent must perceive differences in remuneration based on their effort level.

The challenge is to find the optimal balance between incentive provision and risk distribution. In the case of a risk-neutral agent, this was not a significant issue, as simply transferring residual control to the agent solved the problem. However, in this case, any variable compensation scheme must compensate the risk-averse agent for the risk they bear.

For comparison, let's keep the utility function and parameters from the previous section. If the principal desires low effort, a fixed salary of $81$ is sufficient. However, to incentive high effort, the contract with $w = 144$ will no longer suffice because effort is not observable, and uniform wages provide an incentive to cheat by exerting low effort.

The contract that induces high effort must meet both the individual rationality and incentive compatibility constraints, expressed as:

$$
0.75U(W_E) + 0.25U(W_F) - 3 \geq 9
$$

$$
0.75U(W_E) + 0.25U(W_F) - 3 \geq 0.25U(W_E) + 0.75U(W_F)
$$

The second constraint can be written as $0.5[U(W_E) - U(W_F)] \geq 3$. This captures the difference in utilities associated with the remuneration in each state, ensuring that high effort is chosen over low effort. The solution for this system of equation is $W_E = 182.25$ and $W_F = 56.25$. The expected cost of the contract that incentives high effor for the principal is $0.75 \times 182.25 + 0.25 \times 56.25 = 159.75$, leaving them with an expected net benefit of $320 - 159.75 = 169.25$.

It is important to note that inducing high effort now has a higher cost for the principal compared to the observable effort case. The cost has increased from $144$ to $159.75$. The additional $6.75$ is the cost of non-observability, which economically corresponds to compensating the agent for the risk assumed.

# General model of moral hazard

This section borrows from @Lambert_2001 Chapter 2 and @Bolton_Dewatripont_2005 Chapter 4. Here we develop more general version of the moral hazard problem. We start by stating the more general framework, and then applying for specific functional forms for the level of effort and performance outcome.

Moral hazard problems can be modeled as sequential games where, in the first stage, the principal offers a contract, and in the second stage, the agent must accept or reject it and then choose their level of effort. Thus, it is a problem that can be solved using backward induction.

In the final stage of the game, the agent chooses a level of effort considering the $n$ potential performance outcomes.

$$
e \in \max \sum_{i=1}^n p_i(e)U(w(x_i)) - v(e)
$$

This condition corresponds to the incentive compatibility constraint. In the immediately preceding stage, the agent decides whether to participate in the contract:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n p_i(e)U(w(x_i)) - v(e) \geq \underline{U}
$$

This corresponds to the participation constraint.

In the first stage of the problem, the principal designs the contract , anticipating the agent’s behavior. Formally, the contract proposed by the principal is the solution to:

$$
\max \sum_{i=1}^n p_i(e)[B(x_i - w(x_i))]
$$

Subject to:

$$
\underline{U} \leq \sum_{i=1}^n p_i(e)U(w(x_i)) - v(e)
$$

$$
e \in \max \sum_{i=1}^n p_i(e)U(w(x_i)) - v(e)
$${#eq-agent_problem}

## First-order simplification

The constraint in @eq-agent_problem is not very tractable, and theorist have develop conditions where it can be replaced by the agent's first-order condition on effort. If we assume that the agent's optimal effort is in the interior of the effort set, then the agent first-order condition is

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n p_i'(e)U(w(x_i)) - v'(e)=0
$$

The issue with this method is that the first-order condition is necessary but not sufficient. Effort is present in both the disutility function $v(e)$ and the probability distribution of results, implying that the expected utility function is not necessarily concave. Therefore, the first-order approach may yield more solutions than the original problem, potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes for the principal. We must impose restrictions on the conditional distribution of outcomes given effort to ensure that the second-order condition holds.

## Solving optimal contract

The Lagrangian for the principal’s problem using the first-condition approach is:

$$
L(w(x),e) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i(e)[B(x_i - w(x_i))]+ \lambda \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n p_i(e)U(w(x_i)) - v(e) -\underline{U}  \right] + \mu \left[\sum_{i=1}^n p_i'(e)U(w(x_i)) - v'(e)\right]
$$

we can characterize the optimal contract by deriving the Lagrangian with respect to $w$ for each value of $x$. This contract must satisfy that

$$
\frac{B'(x_i - w(x_i))}{U'(w(x_i)) }= \lambda + \mu \frac{p_i'(e)}{p_i(e)}
$$ {#eq-op_sharing}

So, $\mu=0$ reduces the optimal contract to the first-best solution. @Holmstrom_1979 shows that as long as the principal aims to influence more effort than the lowest possible, then $\mu>0$. In those cases, the optimal risk sharing depends on the sign and magnitude of $\frac{p_i'(e)}{p_i(e)}$. An statistical interpretation of this ratio is that the principal use the outcome $x$ to infer the parameter $e$, that is, the effort level taken [@Milgrom_1981]. In other words, the principal rewards the outcomes that are more likely to happen with higher level of efforts ($p_i'(e)>0$).

@eq-op_sharing indicates that the optimal contract shape depends on the functional form for the principal's and agent's utility functions as well as for outcome distribution function. Depending on these settings, the optimal contract can be linear, convex, or concave in $x$. A sufficient condition for the contract to be monotonically increasing in the outcome is that $\frac{p_i'(e)}{p_i(e)}$is increasing in the outcome (called **monotone likelihood ratio condition**, MLRC ), which is a stronger condition the the mean of the outcome distribution to increase with the outcome. This condition is meet by many common probability functions.

::: callout-note
## Linearity in the Outcome

Even if the likelihood ratio is monotonic and linear in the outcome, this would not imply that the optimal compensation is also linear in the outcome. As @eq-op_sharing shows, the shape of the contract also depends on the preference functions of the agent and the principal.
:::

For example, assuming the the principal is risk neutral and the agent's has an hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility function, then the optimal compensation is a concave function of the outcome, as shown in @eq-hara.

$$
\begin{align*}
U(x) &=\frac{1}{1-\gamma}\left(\delta_0+\delta_1 x\right)^(1-\gamma)\\
w^*(x) &= -\frac{ \delta_0}{ \delta_1 x} + \delta_1^{(1-\gamma)/\gamma} \left[ \lambda + \mu \frac{p_i'(e)}{p_i(e)} \right]^{1/\gamma}
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-hara}

Thus, the optimal contract is linear in the outcome if $\gamma=1$ (e.g., logarithmic utility function), and concave (convex) if $\gamma>1$ ($\gamma<1$).

::: callout-note
## Limited Liability

In many instances, the optimal compensation needs to be bounded below given limited liability or wealth constraints of the agent. The problem is that @eq-op_sharing implies penalization to the agent for bad outcomes. Therefore, the optimal compensation is often nondifferentiable and has a piecewise linear form. See @Mirrlees_1974.
:::

## Accounting performance measures

Now let's add an additional performance measure to the model to check in which conditions they reduced the welfare loss relative to the first-best solution. This will be the case if they increase the agent's incentive to exert effort or improve the risk-sharing between the principal and the agent. Be $y$ the performance measure. In this case, @eq-op_sharing becomes

$$
\frac{B'(x_i - w(x_i,y_i))}{U'(w(x_i,y_i)) }= \lambda + \mu \frac{p_i'(x,y;e)}{p_i(x,y;e)}
$$ {#eq-op_sharing_2}

Thus, the optimal contract depends on the performance metric if $\frac{p_i'(x,y;e)}{p_i(x,y;e)}$ also depends on $y$. However, if $x$ is a sufficient statistic for $x$ and $y$ with respect to $e$, then the optimal contract is independent of $y$. This is called Holmstrom's informativeness condition [@Holmstrom_1979].

::: callout-tip
## Sufficient Statistic

If $x=e+a_1$ and $y=x+a_2$, where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are independent random variables, then $x$ is a **sufficient statistic** for $x$ and $y$ with respect to $e$. In other words, $y$ does not add any information about $e$ that is not already contained in $x$.
:::

Accounting systems aggregate performance measures. The demand for aggregation of performance measures arises because reporting all the basic transactions and other nonfinancial information is costly and unrealistic. Accountants aggregate linearly these measures assigning equal weights to each them. For example, total cost is the sum of each cost item, net benefits is revenues minus expenses. Furthermore, in practice, performance evaluation and compensation usually rely on those accounting aggregated metrics. To what extent contract theory support the linear aggregation of performance with equal weights? @Banker_1989 provide theoretical support for the linear aggregation but also highlight that the equal weights assumption is rarely optimal. The components of the performance measure should be weighted according to agent's capacity to influence them and their noisiness. Thus, only in cases where the signal-to-noise ratio is the same for all components, the equal weights assumption might be optimal. To see this, let's continue with the same example but now assume that the principal is risk neutral and that $x$ and $y$ are both performance metrics. The optimal contract is given by @eq-op_sharing_2 and yields

$$
w^*(x,y)= W \left[ \lambda + \mu \frac{p_i'(x,y;e)}{p_i(x,y;e)} \right]
$$

where $W$ is the inverse of the agent's marginal utility function. Let's define the aggregate performance measure as $\pi(x,y)=\lambda + \mu \frac{p_i'(x,y;e)}{p_i(x,y;e)}$. For many probability distributions, such as those in the exponential family, the likelihood ratio is linear in $x$ and $y$, thus the optimal contract supports linear aggregation. In terms of the optimal weights, @Banker_1989 shows that for the exponential family of distribution, when both metrics are independently distributed given the agent's effort, then the optimal weights are proportional to (1) the sensitivity of the metric to the effort, and (2) to the inverse of the variance of the performance metrics. If we denote the weights as $\beta_x$ and $\beta_y$, then the optimal weights are given by

$$ 
\beta_x  = \frac{\frac{\partial E(x;e)}{ \partial e} var(y) }{ \left[ var(x)+var(y) \right]}
$$

and 
$$
\beta_y  = \frac{\frac{\partial E(y;e)}{ \partial e} var(x) }{ \left[ var(x)+var(y) \right]}
$$ 

and the relative weights are

$$
\frac{\beta_x}{\beta_y} = \frac{\partial E(x;e)/ \partial e}{var(x)} \frac{var(y)}{\partial E(y;e)/ \partial e}
$$ {#eq-optimal_weights}

::: callout-note
## The relevance of variables not controlled by the agent

If the principal or other agent invest in technology or capital such as the agent's effort is more productive or the performance metric is more sensitive to its effort, then it is optimal to introduce those variables into the contract even though are not controlled by the agent. In this case, the optimal contract adjusts the compensation to subtract the principal's investment effect on the mean outcome or adjusts the weights of the performance metrics to reflect their new informativeness.
:::

How the optimal contract should weights performance metrics that are correlated? In that case, @eq-optimal_weights is rewritten as

$$
\frac{\beta_x}{\beta_y} = \frac{ \frac{\partial E(x;e)}{\partial e} - \frac{cov(x,y)}{var(y)}\frac{\partial E(y;e)}{\partial e} }{var(x)} \frac{var(y)}{\frac{\partial E(y;e)}{\partial e} - \frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)}\frac{\partial E(x;e)}{\partial e}}
$$ {#eq-optimal_weights_2}

so, even if the agent does not control $y$ (e.g., $\frac{\partial E(y;e)}{\partial e}=0$) then both metrics should be included in the contract with weights that reflect the correlation between them.

$$
\frac{\beta_x}{\beta_y} = -\frac{var(y)}{covar(x,y)}
$$

Thus, if the metrics are positively correlated, then their weights have opposite signs. The interpretation is that the positive correlation is driven by an exogenous common factor, and by adjusting $y$ with a negative weight some of the noise driven by the common factor in $x$ is removed.

# Linear-exponential-normal (LEN) models

Now we develop another widely used model considering linear contracts, normally distributed performance and exponential utility for the agent. The performance outcome is assumed to be equal to effort (in monetary terms) plus noise: $x=e+\epsilon$, with $\epsilon\sim N(0,\sigma^{2})$. We keep considering the principal to be risk neutral while the agent's utility function is CARA represented by a negative exponential utility function $u(w,e)=-e^{-\eta\left[w-\psi(e)\right]}$, with $\psi(e)=\frac{1}{2}ce^{2}$. Therefore, the principal only cares about the expected cost of motivating the agent to accept the contract and exert effort and not about risk sharing.

In these models, the contract follows a linear form such as $w=t+sx$ where $t$ is a fix component and $s$ is the performance-related component.

The problem for the principal is then:

$$ \underset{e,t,s}{\max}\mathbb{E}\left[x-w\right] $$

subject to:

$$ \mathbb{E}\left[u(w,e)\right]\geq u(\overline{w},e) $$

as the agent's participation constraint where $\overline{w}$ denotes the minimum acceptable certain monetary equivalent , and

$$ e\in\arg\max\mathbb{E}\left[u(w,\tilde{e})\right] $$

as the agent's incentive compatibility constraint.

## Solving optimal contract

As $\mathbb{E}\left[e^{k\epsilon}\right]=e^{k^{2}\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}}$ for any $k$, the expected agent's utility is

$$ \mathbb{E}\left[u(w,e)\right] =-e^{-\eta\left[t+se-\frac{1}{2}ce^{2}-s^{2}\eta\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right]}.$$

Now we can reformulate the agent's problem as 

$$
a\in\arg\max\hat{w}(a)=t+sa-\frac{1}{2}ca^{2}-s^{2}\eta\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}
$$

obtaining $a^*=\frac{s}{c}$. So for any given performance incentive s, the principal knows the effort choice of the agent. Introducing this condition into the principal problem reduces the optimization variables (now only the contract terms) and the number of restrictions. By solving the principal model, we obtain the optimal contract:

$$ 
\begin{align*}
s^{*} &= \frac{1}{\left[1+c\eta\sigma^{2}\right]}\\
t^{*} &= \overline{w}-\frac{1-c\eta\sigma^{2}}{2c\left[1+c\eta\sigma^{2}\right]^{2}}
\end{align*}
$$

so the variable compensation is high when the cost of effort $c$ is low, the degree of risk aversion $\eta$ is low, and randomness of the output $\sigma$ is low.

```{python}

s = 1/(1+c*eta*sigma**2)
t = w - (1-c*eta*sigma**2)/(2*c*(1+c*eta*sigma**2)**2) 
total = t + s 
effort = s/c

plt.plot(sigma, u_principal, label='Principal')

plt.show()

```

## Accounting perfomance measures

Let's again assume again that $x$ and $y$ are both accounting signals, such as $x=e+\epsilon_x$ and $y=2e+\epsilon_y$, where $\epsilon_x$ and $\epsilon_y$ are joinly normally distributed with zero means. Then, the joint distribution function $f(x,y;e)$ is a bivariate normal distribution with 

- Mean vector:
$$
  \mu_{x,y} = \left(\begin{array}{c} e \\ 2e \end{array}\right)
$$
  
- Covariance matrix:
$$
 \Sigma_{x,y} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} \sigma_x^2 & \rho \sigma_x \sigma_y \\ \rho \sigma_x \sigma_y & \sigma_y^2 \end{array}\right)
$$

where  $\sigma_x^2$ is the variance of $\epsilon_x$, $\sigma_y^2$ is the variance of $\epsilon_y$, and $\rho$ is the correlation coefficient between $\epsilon_x$ and $\epsilon_y$. The @eq-optimal_weights_2  becomes

$$
\frac{\beta_x}{\beta_y} = \frac{1-2\frac{\rho \sigma_x \sigma_y}{\sigma_y^2}}{\sigma_x^2}\frac{\sigma_y^2}{2-\frac{\rho \sigma_x \sigma_y}{\sigma_x^2}}
$$

Let's see the comparative statics of the optimal weights for different values of $\rho$ and $\sigma_y$.
First, let's assume that both signals have the same noise, $\sigma_x=\sigma_y=2.5$.

```{python}
# plot the beta_x/beta_y for different values of rho 
rho = np.linspace(-1,1,20)
sigma_y = 2.5
sigma_x = 2.5
# subplot for rho
beta_rho = (1-2*(rho*sigma_x*sigma_y)/(sigma_y)**2)/(sigma_x**2)*(sigma_y**2)/(2-(rho*sigma_x*sigma_y)/(sigma_x)**2)
plt.plot(rho, beta_rho)
plt.xlabel('correlation coefficient')
# add vertical line in x=0
plt.axvline(x=0, color='r', linestyle='--')
## add subtitle
plt.title('Relative Optimal Weights')
plt.show()
```
so, if $\rho=0$, the optimal contract weight for $x$ is half of the weight for $y$, as this second signal is more sensitive to effort and has the same noise. If $\rho=-1$, then both both signal have full positive weight in the contract. If $\rho=1$, then the signals are substracted from each other in the contract to remove the common noise.

Now, let's see the comparative statics for different values of $\sigma_y$, considering $\rho=0$ and $\sigma_x=2.5$.

```{python}
# plot the beta_x/beta_y for different values of sigma_y
rho=0
sigma_y = np.linspace(0.1,5,10)
sigma_x = 2.5
# plot for sigma_y
beta_sigma_y = (1-2*(rho*sigma_x*sigma_y)/(sigma_y)**2)/(sigma_x**2)*(sigma_y**2)/(2-(rho*sigma_x*sigma_y)/(sigma_x)**2)
plt.axvline(x=2.5, color='r', linestyle='--')
plt.plot(sigma_y, beta_sigma_y)
plt.xlabel('Value of $\sigma_y$')
plt.title('Relative Optimal Weights')
plt.show()

```
Here the red line the same situation than in the previous plot, meaning that when both signals have the same noise, the optimal weight for $x$ is half of the weight for $y. If $\sigma_y$ gets closer to zero, then the weight for $x$ decreases as $y$ gets better signal-to-noise ratio.
