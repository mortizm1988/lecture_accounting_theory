# Communication of Private information

In this section we discuss models where the agent has **private information** that is not observable to the principal, which introduces challenges in aligning incentives. The agent's private information can relate to various factors, such as their skill, expertise, or the profitability of investment opportunities. This informational asymmetry means that the agent holds an **information rent** which allows him to potentially extract more value than he could if the principal were fully informed. The key challenge for the principal is to design contracts that minimize these rents while still providing incentives for the agent to act in the firm's best interest.



Let $x$ and $y$ be the outcome and additional metric, both observable at the end of the game. The agent’s private information signal $m$ has a priori probability density function $G(m)$. As before, the agent's effort is $e$. Once the signal is received, the density function of the outcome and the other metric is updated to be $f(x,y|e,m)$. The models differs in three aspects: First, when does the agent receive the signal $m$, second, whether the agent can leave the contract after observing $m$, and third, whether the agent can communicate $m$ to the principal in a trustfull way.

## Principal's Problem

We start with the scenario where the agent acquires private information after signing the contract but before choosing his action. He is unable to leave after observing the signal and cannot communicate the signal to the principal. After receiving the private information, the agent can adjust his effort level on the signal, meaning $e(m)$. The optimal compensation $w(x,y)$ cannot depend on the signal $m$ because the agent cannot communicate it to the principal. 

The principal's problem is

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \max_{w(x,y),e(m)} \quad & \mathbb{E}_{x, y, m} \left[ G[x - w(x,y)] | e(m) \right] \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & \mathbb{E}_{x, y, m} \left[ U[w(x, y)| e(m)] - V[e(m)] \right] \geq \underline{U} \text{ for all } m, \quad & \text{(PCs)}\\
    & e(m) \in \arg\max \mathbb{E}_{x, y | m} \left[ U[w(x, y) | e] - V(e) \right] \text{ for each } m \quad & \text{(ICCs)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that now the principal's problem include a set of PCs and ICCs, each of them for a different signal $m$. To avoid that the agent to leave after observing bad realizations of the signal, the principal should offer a contract that is better than the outside options for every realization, not just in expectations. This implies that the agent obtains an excess level of utility, called **information rent**, derived from the fact that the agent earns the minimal acceptable level of utility just in the realization of the worst signal, and earns in excess to this minimal level in the other realizations. The principal can reduce the information rent by forcing the agent to truthfully report the private information. In those cases, the principal can use this information as an additional metric to adjust the contract to reduce the information rent.

However,  given the private nature of the information and the incentive scheme, the principal knows that the agent has incentive to misreport the signal. Let $\color{blue}\hat{m}(m)$ be the report that the agent sends after observing $m$. The principal can design a different contract that depends on the reported signal, $w(x,y,\textcolor{blue}{\hat{m}})$. The principal's problem is then



$$
\begin{aligned}
    \max_{w(x,y,\textcolor{blue}{\hat{m}}),e(m), \textcolor{blue}{\hat{m}(m)}} \quad & \mathbb{E}_{x, y, m} \left[ G[x - w(x,y,\textcolor{blue}{\hat{m}})] | e(m) \right] \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & \mathbb{E}_{x, y| m} \left[ U[w(x, y,\textcolor{blue}{\hat{m}})| e(m)] - V[e(m)] \right] \geq \underline{U} \text{ for all } m,  \\
    & e(m) \in \arg\max \mathbb{E}_{x, y | m} \left[ U[w(x, y,\textcolor{blue}{\hat{m}}) | e] - V(e) \right] \text{ for each } m, \quad  \\
    & \hat{m}(m) \in \arg\max \mathbb{E}_{x, y | m} \left[ U[w(x, y,\textcolor{blue}{\hat{m}}) | e] - V(e) \right] \text{ for all } m \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The first set of constraints consists of the minimal acceptable utility constraints, the second set comprises the incentive compatibility constraints on the agent’s effort, and the third set includes the incentive compatibility constraints on the agent’s communication strategy.

## Relevation Principle

 As the set of possible strategies is very large, the problem for the principal is difficult to solve. A shorcut developed in the literature is the **Relevation Principle**. The revelation principle states that any proposed mechanism that involves nontruthful communication by the agent can be duplicated or beaten in terms of expected utilities by an equilibrium mechanism in which truthful reporting is induced. The cost for forcing the agent to tell the trut is that the principal must commit to not use the information as fully as he would if the truthful message did not have to be motivated. The revelation principle is a very helpful tool for researchers because it reduces the number of alternative reporting strategies needed to be considered. This allows researchers to focus on reporting strategies that encourage truthful reporting. To apply the relevation principal to our problem, we should substitute the report by the true signal, $\textcolor{blue}{\hat{m}}=m$, and set the contract such that it ensures that the best reporting strategy for the agent is to tell the truth.


$$
\begin{aligned}
    \max_{w(x,y,m),e(m), \hat{m}(m)} \quad & \mathbb{E}_{x, y, m} \left[ G[x - w(x,y,m)] | e(m) \right] \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & \mathbb{E}_{x, y| m} \left[ U[w(x, y,m)| e(m)] - V[e(m)] \right] \geq \underline{U} \text{ for all } m,  \\
    & e(m) \in \arg\max \mathbb{E}_{x, y | m} \left[ U[w(x, y,m) | e] - V(e) \right] \text{ for each } m \quad  \\
    & m(m) \text{ is the } \hat{m}(m) \in \arg\max \mathbb{E}_{x, y | m} \left[ U[w(x, y,\hat{m}) | e] - V(e) \right] \text{ for all } m \\
\end{aligned}
$$

In these models, the principal's welfare loss is due to the information rent of the agent, which exists even in contexts with risk neutral agents. For this reason, mos of the model examine private information issues using risk neutral agents, so they can avoid the complexities that result when risk aversion and risk sharing issues are also present.

# Budgeting

For early contributions see @Antle_1985 and @Antle_1997. The model assumed that the agent learn privately the minimal investment amount that will yield a given cash flow $x$ (the outcome of the risky project). To obtain this cash flow, it is needed to initially invest $mx$. The principal provides the capital $z$ that cover the investment and the agent's compensation $w$, but the agent can also divert a fraction of $z$ for its own benefit.

The assume a discrete number of potential information signals that the agent can privately observe: $m \in \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n\}$, which are ordered such that $m_1 < m_2 < \ldots < m_n$. The ex-ante probability of observing $m_i$ is $g_i$.  The principal is risk-neutral with utility function $G(x,z)=x - z$. The agent is also risk neutral with utility function $U(w)=z-m_ix$, meaning the money received from the principal minus how much he invested in the project. As in the initial setting, we assume that the agent can leave after observing a bad  signal. So, notice that the the principal makes the decision on the capital $z$ needed to obtain $x$ based on the communication $\hat{m}$.

## First Best Solution
Let's ignore for now the information assymetry in the cost of the project $m$. The principal's problem is

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \max_{x_i, z_i} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - z_i) g_i \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & z_i - m_i x_i \geq \underline{U} \quad \text{for all } i = 1, \dots, N, \\
    & 0 \leq x_i \leq x_{\max}, \\
    & 0 \leq z_i.
\end{aligned}
$$

Here the second and third restrictions set bounds on the cashflows and transference for the solution to exist (notice the linearity in the production technology and lack of agent's wealth). The first restriction is the minimal acceptable utility constraint for the agent regardless of the signal observed. 
The first restrictions implies that $z_i^*=\underline{U}+m_i x_i$. Inserting this into the objective function, we obtain  

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \max_{x_i} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{N} (1-m_i)(x_i g_i)-\underline{U}  \\
\end{aligned}
$$
which is maximized when $x_i=x_{\max}$ if $m_i\leq 1$ and $x_i=0$ if $m_i> 1$. The intuition is that the expected value of the principa's profits is at its maximum when the agent invests the maximum amount in the project if the signal indicates that the cost of the project is below the value of the output (i.e., 1.0), and zero otherwise. Consistently, the optimal transfer is

$$
z_i = 
\begin{cases} 
    m_i x_{\max} + \underline{U} & \text{for } m_i \leq 1, \\
    \underline{U} & \text{for } m_i > 1.
\end{cases}
$$
 meaning that when the cost of the project is below the value of the output, the transfer should be the minimum acceptable utility plus the cost of the project. In contrast, when the cost is above the value of the output, the principal should transfer the minimum utility of the agent.

## Communication Strategies

Suppose the agent sees signal $m_i$ but reports a higher cost $m_j$ to obtain more the resources than needed ($(m_j-m_i)x_j+\underline{U}$). However, there is a limit to how much he will overstate. If the agent claims the cost is too high (over 1), the principal will not provide any resources. Thus, the agent will report a cost slightly under 1 for all $m_i<1$. If the agent observes a cost realization above 1, there is no incentive to lie because the project will not be funded anyway. As previously mentioned, the principal does not need to worry about the agent understating their costs. If he does, he will not receive enough resources to produce the required output, so any lie in this direction will always be uncovered.

### Principal's Problem
The principal's problem is to define a set of contract ($x_i,z_i$) that depends on the reported signal, $z_i(\hat{m})$ such that the agent's best reporting strategy is to tell the truth. The principal's problem is then

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \max_{x_i, z_i} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - z_i) g_i \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & z_i - m_i x_i \geq \underline{U} \quad \text{for all } i = 1, \dots, N, \\
    & z_i - m_i x_i \geq z_j - m_i x_j \quad \text{for all } i, j, \\
    & 0 \leq x_i \leq x_{\max} \quad \text{for all } i, \\
    & 0 \leq z_i.
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that this version adds the second set of $N^2$ restrictions, which ensures that the agent does not have an incentive to lie about the cost of the project (**truth-telling constraints**, or **self-section restriction**). These restrictions implies that when the agent observes the cost $m_i$, he is better off with the contract ($x_i,z_i$) than with any other combitation ($x_j,z_j$). However, the set of constraints can be reduced to consider the set of 2(N - 1) "adjacent" constraints, meaning that the conditions that the manager prefers the communicate the true cost to the cost immediately above and the cost immediately below dominates the others.

The upper bound restrictions in the cash flow can also be simplified to a single restriction $x_N\leq X_{\max}$

The **agent's slack**  $z_i-m_i x_i$, decreases weakly in $i$ because as $m_i$​ increases (i.e., higher costs), both $x_i$​ and $z_i$ decreases in $i$. In the worst realization of $i$, the minimum acceptable utility is  is $z_N-m_N x_N=\theta$.

Let $k^*$ be the value of $i$ that maximizes the principal's problem. This implies that $x_i=x_{\max}$ for $i=1,...,k^*$ and $x_i=0$ for all $i=k^*+1,...,N$. Since $z_1=m_1 x_1+\theta$, and then $z_{i}-z_{i-1}=m_i(x_i-x_{i-1})$ for $i=2,...,N$, the transfer policy is


$$
z_i = 
\begin{cases} 
    m_{k^*} x_{\max} & \text{for } i=1,...,k^*, \\
    0 & \text{for } i=k^*+1,...,N
\end{cases}
$$

Note that additional resources will be allocated to the agent for all actual costs below the specified threshold. It is noteworthy that the most effective cutoff point is less than 1.0. This implies that the optimal solution involves the principal rejecting certain profitable projects (**capital rationing**). When the principal adjusts the  threshold level, it impacts the flexibility the agent has for all lower levels below the threshold. Therefore, by lowering the threshold below 1.0, the principal is sacrificing production in some situations to limit the flexibility the agent has in other situations.

Pending to add numerical example.
