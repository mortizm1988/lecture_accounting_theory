# Economic Theory and Accounting: an Introduction

These lecture notes cover an introductory course on Accounting and Economics. They are based on a series of articles and books that I have connected using a common framework. This course aims to provide a coherent framework for understanding the role of accounting in economic theory for non-theorists, rather than focusing on theory. As a result, formality is kept to a minimum, and the main focus is on the intuition behind the most commonly used models. Additionally, I provide all the Python code used to solve the models and generate the figures and tables in the notes.

- [Optimal Compensation](https://marceloortizm.com/theory_lecture_notes/mora_hazard.html) We start by developing a simple example of a moral hazard problem to illustrate the nature of the problem and the trade-offs involved in solving it. We then develop a general moral hazard model, allowing us to add further features to the model. We discuss how accounting systems must generate **performance measures**, and how these measures can be used to design optimal contracts. We refer to studies focusing on **relative performance evaluation** and how to incorporate **stock-based compensation** in the model. 

- [Capital Budgeting and the Charge for Capital](https://marceloortizm.com/theory_lecture_notes/private_inf.html) We develop a general model of communication of private information, and then apply it for **capital budgeting** and **charging the agent for capital allocated**. 

Pending topics:

- Disclosure Strategy
- Accounting Information and Cost of Capital

The notes borrow heavily from [Lambert (2001)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165410101000374?via%3Dihub), [Verrechia (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-4101(01)00025-8), [Bushman and Smith (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-4101(01)00027-1), [Bolton and Dewatripont (2005)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262025768/contract-theory/), and the material provided in the Accounting Theory Summer School organized by the Accounting and Economics Society in NYU in 2024. That material was elaborated by Ilan Guttman, Judson Caskey, and Jeremy Bertomeu.
