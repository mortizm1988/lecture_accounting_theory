# Introduction to Moral Hazard Theory and Accounting

Moral hazard arises when one party in a transaction can take actions that affect the value of the transaction for the other party. However, those actions are either unobservable or only imperfectly inferable by the affected party. This problem typically occurs in situations where two conditions are present: **hidden action** and **risk aversion**.

1. **Hidden action**: Refers to actions taken by one party that cannot be directly monitored or measured by the other party. As a result, the affected party cannot perfectly determine whether adverse outcomes are due to poor performance, lack of effort, or external factors.

2. **Risk aversion**: At least one of the parties involved must prefer avoiding risk. They value stability and predictability, often making them cautious about transactions or agreements that expose them to unpredictable outcomes.

The moral hazard problem is fundamentally about the misalignment of incentives between parties. Specifically, the party whose actions are unobservable might not have adequate incentives to act in the best interest of the other party. 

Solving Moral hazard conflicts implies solving two challenges:

1. **Provision of adequate incentives**: Designing mechanisms to motivate the party taking the hidden action to behave in a way that aligns with the other party's goals.
2. **Efficient risk distribution**: Finding a balance in how risk is shared between the parties, so that each party bears the appropriate level of risk without undermining incentives.

These two objectives often conflict. There is a substitution effect: when one party is overly shielded from risk, they may lack the incentive to take efficient actions that benefit the other party. As a result, designing an optimal compensation or incentive scheme requires balancing risk-sharing with providing the right incentives.

The focus of this class will be moral hazard conflicts arising within a firm, typically between a shareholder (the pricipal) and a manager (the agent). The principal aims to hire the agent for running a risky project, and offers the agent a contract which stablishes the agent's compensation conditional on the outcome of the risky project. The agent first decides whether to accept the contract and then how much effort put into managing the project. The principal requires informations to infer the value of the project's outcome and the agent's effort  to be able to compute the agent's compensation and its own net profits. 

In this setting, accounting is naturally embedded into moral hazard problems. **Accounting information** must have several key characteristics to be useful for decision-making. Accounting information must be relevant, comparable, verifiable, and timeliness. Scholars have studied how these characteristics can be used to design optimal contracts that mitigate moral hazard problems. 

This reading note starts by developing a simple example of a moral hazard problem to illustrate the nature of the problem and the trade-offs involved in solving it. We then move on to a more general moral hazard model, allowing us to add further features to the model. We will also discuss how accounting systems must generate **performance measures**, and how these measures can be used to design optimal contracts. Then, we discuss the role of comparability for **relative performance evaluation** and the role of disclosure of **verifiable** private information in the context of moral hazard. Lastly, we will discuss how the **timeliness** of accounting information can be used to design dynamic incentive contracts.
