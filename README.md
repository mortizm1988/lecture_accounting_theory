# Moral Hazard Theory and Accounting

This reading notes start by developing a simple example of a moral hazard problem to illustrate the nature of the problem and the trade-offs involved in solving it. We then move on to a more general moral hazard model, allowing us to add further features to the model. We will also discuss how accounting systems must generate **performance measures**, and how these measures can be used to design optimal contracts. Then, we discuss the role of comparability for **relative performance evaluation** and the role of disclosure of **verifiable** private information in the context of moral hazard. Lastly, we will discuss how the **timeliness** of accounting information can be used to design dynamic incentive contracts.
